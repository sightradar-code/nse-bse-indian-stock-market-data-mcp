## What is this?

Tapetide MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) server that connects AI assistants to real-time Indian stock market data. It covers all ~8,200 stocks listed on NSE and BSE — from large-cap Nifty 50 to SME stocks.

Ask your AI to look up any stock, run a screener with 326 fundamental filters or real-time technical indicators, pull quarterly financials, check analyst consensus ratings, track your portfolio P&L, monitor FII/DII institutional flows, or get today's bulk deals — all through natural language.

**Compatible with:** Claude Desktop, Claude Code, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, Kiro, VS Code, Codex, Zed, Gemini, Grok, OpenCode, Antigravity, and any MCP-compatible client.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Remote MCP (No install — claude.ai, chatgpt.com, Grok, Gemini)

Add this URL directly in your AI chat app:

```
https://mcp.tapetide.com/mcp
```

Authentication happens automatically via Google OAuth. No token needed.

### Option 2: Remote MCP with Token (Claude Code, VS Code, Kiro, Zed)

For code editors that support URL-based MCP servers with custom headers:

1. Get a free token at [tapetide.com/settings/tokens](https://tapetide.com/settings/tokens)
2. Add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tapetide": {
      "type": "url",
      "url": "https://mcp.tapetide.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 3: Local MCP via npm (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Gemini CLI, Kiro, OpenCode)

For stdio-based MCP clients. No cloning or building required — runs via `npx`:

1. Get a free token at [tapetide.com/settings/tokens](https://tapetide.com/settings/tokens)
2. Add to your MCP config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tapetide": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "tapetide-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TAPETIDE_TOKEN": "your_token_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Node.js 18+** required for the local option. Run `node --version` to check.

## How It Works

```
┌─────────────────┐     stdio (JSON-RPC)     ┌──────────────────┐     HTTPS      ┌─────────────────────┐
│  AI Assistant   │ ◄──────────────────────► │  tapetide-mcp    │ ◄────────────► │  mcp.tapetide.com   │
│  (Claude, etc.) │                           │  (npm package)   │                │  (Cloudflare Worker) │
└─────────────────┘                           └──────────────────┘                └─────────────────────┘
```

The npm package is a lightweight stdio bridge (~300 lines, zero runtime dependencies). It:

- Reads JSON-RPC from stdin, forwards to the remote Tapetide MCP server, writes responses to stdout
- Auto-detects framing: Content-Length (VS Code, Claude Desktop) or newline-delimited JSON (Kiro, Claude Code)
- Exchanges your refresh token for a 1-hour HMAC access token, auto-refreshes before expiry
- Handles SSE responses from the remote server
- Warns on stderr when approaching rate limits

All 34 tools and their logic run on the remote server — the npm package is just the transport layer.

## Authentication

| Method | How it works | Best for |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Google OAuth** | Browser sign-in, automatic token refresh | AI chat apps (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Grok, Gemini) |
| **Personal Token (remote)** | `Authorization: Bearer tpt_rt_...` header | Code editors with URL-based MCP (VS Code, Kiro, Zed) |
| **Personal Token (local)** | `TAPETIDE_TOKEN` env var via npx | stdio MCP clients (Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Codex) |

Generate a free personal token at [tapetide.com/settings/tokens](https://tapetide.com/settings/tokens). Works for both remote and local MCP.
